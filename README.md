# CVGEN
I am currently in my pre final year and i found out that students are having problems with drafting resume with a well formatted template. Through this project i have tried to solve that problem by taking user inputj and bringing out the dream of a perfect resume to reality. Well you can say that the project is nothing but simple database operations, yes i agree to some extent, but in my case it not only has enhanced my learning but has also increased my confidence that i could solve problems and yes i have done it on my own! ðŸ¥¹
Cheers , lets keep building
